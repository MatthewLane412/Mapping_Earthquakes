# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

This analysis was using GeoJSON. Pulling in a map of the world from mapBox and using the leaflet library for JavaScript. Once the data is pulled in from JSON files on the web, it is displayed using HTML. Some of the main coding practices used include setting variables, setting the center of the map, different versions of maps in mapbox, utilizing functions, conditional statements, and pulling in JSON data. 

## Results
Most earthquakes were on the fault lines. This was even more true of major earthquakes. At the point of time in this analysis, most major earthquakes were in the eastern part of Asia. The United States had the most small earthquakes, mostly along the fault line on the western side of the country.

## Summary

In summary, this was a fun exercise. I really appreciated what we can accomplish by referencing external links with JavaScript. There is a lot of neat data on the web that can be mapped using map box.
